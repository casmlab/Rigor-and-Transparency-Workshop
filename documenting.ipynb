A lot of what I do is analogous to the work you do. Here's a very high level list of my tasks:\n",

Code I wrote two hours ago might as well have been written by a stranger. I've thought about too many other things to remember what I was working on, how far I'd gotten in that particular task, and what decisions I'd made along the way. Enter notebooks. They allow me to store my thought process, my work, and its output all in the same place. I don't have to remember where I put a particular file or how my table was produced because the line of code that gets the data is in the same place as the line of code that generates the table. In between notebooks let me add comments that are human-readable (no # marks or weird colors or fonts) by using Markdown. \n",

You can play this notebook with our data and retrain the models we created, regenerate the tables in our paper, and inspect the data at the same points we did. You won't see many explicit comments (i.e., #'ed lines) or markdown cells in that notebook because storing the generation, analysis, and output together minimizes the need for documentation. This code is nearly _self-documenting_ because it uses elements such as variables names and structure to guide readers through the work. It also makes output easy to find because you also don't have to point to carefully named ```.tex``` or ```.png``` files somewhere else because the tables and figures are right there."

    "The notebook approach makes documentation easier, meaning we are each more likely to do it. It also improves the transparency of our work by revealing the code we used to manipulate and analyze our data. Being able to understand the code requires a level of expertise with whatever language is employed---my examples were both in Python, but Julia, R, and 90 other languages are supported. But I think we can agree that the notebooks contain far more detail in a more usable structure than a standard methods section or even static appendix."
