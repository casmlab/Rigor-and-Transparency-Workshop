They allow me to store my thought process, my work, and its output all in the same place. I don't have to remember where I put a particular file or how my table was produced because the line of code that gets the data is in the same place as the line of code that generates the table.

You won't see many explicit comments (i.e., #'ed lines) or markdown cells in that notebook because storing the generation, analysis, and output together minimizes the need for documentation. This code is nearly _self-documenting_ because it uses elements such as variables names and structure to guide readers through the work. It also makes output easy to find because you also don't have to point to carefully named ```.tex``` or ```.png``` files somewhere else because the tables and figures are right there."

    "The notebook approach makes documentation easier, meaning we are each more likely to do it.

Being able to understand the code requires a level of expertise with whatever language is employed &mdash; my examples were both in Python, but Julia, R, and 90 other languages are supported. But I think we can agree that the notebooks contain far more detail in a more usable structure than a standard methods section or even static appendix. Version control systems, which Cristina will talk about shortly, also render Jupyter in the browser so that notebooks can be read without running or exporting. "
